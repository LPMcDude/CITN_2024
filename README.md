# CITN_2024
Code and Slides from CITN 2024

Thanks for attending my SQL Server session at CITN in Dallas.  I hope you got something useful out of the session and maybe even made some new friends or gained confidence in your SQL skills.  I definitely don't have all the answers, but always like talking about this kind of stuff, and try to help where I can.  Please reach out on RocketChat or Discord if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.

Cheers!
Jeff "McDude" McClure
